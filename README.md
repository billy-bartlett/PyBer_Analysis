# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

For this project, I was asked to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019. I performed the analysis in Jupyter Notebook and created a multiple-line chart to visualize the data in a single compelling visual.


## Results

Summary:
When looking at the ride sharing data for each city type, I analyzed the following categories: total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

Total Rides per city type trended upward from Rural to Suburban and then up to Urban city types as expected. Fewer people live in rural areas so fewer total rides were both anticipated and identified for this city type. Looking at suburban cities, I anticipated an increase over total rides for rural cities. The data shows an increase from 125 total rides for rurual cities to 625 total rides for suburban cities. Lastly, I anticipated urban cities having the highest number of total rides out of the three city types and I identified there were 1625 total rides for this category. See the image below for reference.

Total Drivers per city type followed the same trend of increasing from rural cities to urban cities. I identified there were 78 drivers in rural cities, 490 drivers in suburban cities, and 2405 drivers in urban cities.

When looking at Total Fares, we can expect a higher total fare for urban cities as there were significantly more rides in urban cities than suburban or rural cities combined. See the image below for reference.

Average Fare per Ride and Driver brought another anticipated result. We can anticipate rides in rural cities to cover more distance and as distance increases, so too does the total fare price (positive correlation). As you can see in the image below, rural cities had the highest average fare per ride and driver followed by suburban cities. Urban cities had the lowest average fare per ride and driver.

## Summary

To increase revenue in rural cities, implementing discounts for rides may increase the number of total rides taken. This would, in turn, potentially increase the overall revenue for PyBer. We also see that January is the lowest month for total fare for urban and suburan cities. Increasing marketing and offering discounts during this month may increase ride demand and drive more revenue. Lastly, we see suburban cities increase total fare in April. Further insight into the "why" may uncover ways to increase total fare for urban and rural cities in the month of April.
